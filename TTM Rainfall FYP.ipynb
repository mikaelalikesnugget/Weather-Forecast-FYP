For details related to model architecture, refer to the [TTM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf).\n","\n","In this example, we will use a pre-trained TTM-512-96 model. That means the TTM model can take an input of 512 time points (`context_length`), and can forecast upto 96 time points (`forecast_length`) in the future. We will use the pre-trained TTM in two settings:\n","1. **Zero-shot**: The pre-trained TTM will be directly used to evaluate on the `test` split of the target data. Note that the TTM was NOT pre-trained on the target data.\n","2. **Few-shot**: The pre-trained TTM will be quickly fine-tuned on only 5% of the `train` split of the target data, and subsequently, evaluated on the `test` part of the target data.\n","\n","Note: Alternatively, this notebook can be modified to try the TTM-1024-96 model.\n","\n","Pre-trained TTM models will be fetched from the [Hugging Face TTM Model Repository](https://huggingface.co/ibm/TTM)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4561dc9c","metadata":{"id":"4561dc9c"},"source":["## Installation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"9fe05685","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9fe05685","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769948672604,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":9549,"user":{"displayName":"uwukirby","userId":"11833786812394280449"}},"outputId":"adf4da95-5d39-4eb0-865b-4a072920a9a8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Cloning into 'tsfm'...\n","remote: Enumerating objects: 14616, done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Counting objects: 100% (3062/3062), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Compressing objects: 100% (444/444), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Total 14616 (delta 2814), reused 2666 (delta 2608), pack-reused 11554 (from 2)\u001b[K\n","Receiving objects: 100% (14616/14616), 93.73 MiB | 20.97 MiB/s, done.\n","Resolving deltas: 100% (10011/10011), done.\n"]}],"source":["# Clone the ibm/tsfm\n","!git clone https://github.com/IBM/tsfm.git"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"be51b4e7","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"be51b4e7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769948692421,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"uwukirby","userId":"11833786812394280449"}},"outputId":"59fc1394-c1b3-4536-e9ff-4a1ece59104f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/tsfm\n"]}],"source":["# Change directory.
